# Distributed Systems Simulation

Simulates distributed systems concepts (mostly uses Golang because of great concurrency control and its ability to model distributed systems inside a computer program running in a single machine) for my personal experiments. I freakin' love this field.

Usage: `go run <concept>/main.go`
